## About me

I am 23 years old, I initially tried to realize myself in the legal industry, which I devoted 5 years of my life, but this area did not meet the requirements of my personal growth. Over the past few years, I have been carefully practicing programming, choosing the Javascript language and the associated infrastructure for development, which I have never regretted. I know that my determination and perseverance will bring the desired result to your company and business. In my free time, I enjoy reading and watching movie, as well as traveling
